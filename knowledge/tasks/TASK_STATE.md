# Cascade Project State â€” Autonomous Agent Reboot

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-21T00:13:41+02:00

---

## Current Status
- All documentation is now modular:
  - [PLAN.md](../history/PLAN.md) contains the current project plan and milestones only.
  - [BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md](../history/BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md) contains the backlog, future ideas, and reference materials.
  - [PROJECT_VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md](../vision/PROJECT_VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md](../protocols/Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md) define vision, architecture, and protocols.
  - [TICKETS_FROM_THE_PAST.md](../history/TICKETS_FROM_THE_PAST.md) archives completed tickets and learnings.
- Agent Manager and Orchestrator support live, in-memory agent lifecycle management, health, and logs.
- All core protocols (A2A, Model Context Protocol) are implemented and referenced in architecture.
- All test suites (Jest, component, integration) are passing and up-to-date.
- No open `task*`, `todo*`, or legacy task files remain in the repo.
- All major documentation files ([README.md](../../README.md), [DOC.md](../../DOC.md), [TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md)) are current and cross-referenced.

## Next Steps for Autonomous Agents
- On reboot, always reference `.PROMPT-Cascade` for canonical project context and file roles.
- Use [PLAN.md](../history/PLAN.md) for current milestones and actionable tasks.
- Use [BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md](../history/BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md) for autonomous backlog selection and reference.
- Log all decisions, learnings, and operational context to persistent memory (Supabase).
- Follow the [Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol](../protocols/Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md) for all actions, escalation, and recovery.
- Update this file after any major project state change or milestone completion.

**Ready for autonomous operation and agent-driven development.**

## Key Files for Cascade
- [README.md](../../README.md), [PLAN.md](../history/PLAN.md), and [DOC.md](../../DOC.md) (see for architecture, backlog, and protocol)
- All code and test files reflect the latest working state.

## Next Steps After Reboot
- Resume with the next failing or incomplete test suite (e.g., `SentryErrorBoundary.test.tsx`) if any.
- Continue development according to the roadmap in [PLAN.md](../history/PLAN.md) and the Cascade Autonomous Protocol.
- Ensure all new features and bugfixes are reflected in this file and the main documentation.

## Reboot Checklist
- [x] All passing tests committed
