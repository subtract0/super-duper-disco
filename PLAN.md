# Project Plan

[Project Vision & Architecture](./PROJECT_VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md) | [Backlog & Reference](./BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md) | [Completed Tickets](./TICKETS_FROM_THE_PAST.md)

---

**Autonomous Operation Notice:**

- All milestones and tasks are designed for stepwise, promptless execution by autonomous agents.
- Agents must always check the latest roadmap, respect ticket boundaries, and update their own progress.
- After each major step, agents must log decisions, learnings, and operational context to persistent memory (Supabase).
- If human review or intervention is required, agents should request it explicitly; otherwise, default to self-recovery/retry.
- All actions must comply with the [Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol](./Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md).

This plan is maintained according to the [Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol](./Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md).

## Milestones & Tasks

### 0. Protocol-Centric Agent Communication (A2A & Model Context Protocol)

- [x] **Objective: Implement A2A and Model Context Protocol as the foundation for all agent communication and context management**
  - [x] Research and document requirements for A2A and Model Context Protocol
  - [x] Build core adapters and middleware for agent-to-agent (A2A) and agent-to-context (Model Context Protocol) messaging
  - [x] Refactor all agent orchestration, messaging, and memory flows to use these protocols as the default
  - [ ] Write comprehensive tests for protocol compliance and edge cases
  - [ ] Document protocol usage and extension points for new agent types
  - [ ] **NEW: Protocol version negotiation for backward compatibility**
  - [ ] **NEW: Automated protocol compliance regression tests**

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration Foundation

- [x] **Objective: Refactor and extend the Agent Manager and Orchestrator for dynamic, in-memory agent lifecycle management and health monitoring**
  - [x] Agents can be launched, stopped, monitored, and auto-recovered
  - [x] Health status, logs, and live state are accessible via API/dashboard
  - [x] Modular support for native, LangChain, and AutoGen agents
  - [x] Audit and refactor `src/orchestration/agentManager.ts` and `agentOrchestrator.ts`
  - [x] Implement in-memory health store, heartbeats, and auto-restart
  - [x] Add/extend API endpoints and dashboard for live state
  - [ ] Tests for orchestrator-state endpoint & health flows
  - [ ] Telegram commands: `/status`, `/stop <id>`, `/restart <id>`
  - [ ] **NEW: Automated chaos testing for agent recovery**
  - [ ] **NEW: Agent performance analytics and reporting**

### 2. Telegram Bot Conversational Interface

- [x] **Objective: Upgrade `/api/telegram` endpoint and bot logic to accept natural language feature requests and route them to the orchestration system**
  - [x] Telegram bot receives feature requests and parses intent
  - [x] Regex-based parser generates actionable agent creation tickets
  - [x] User receives status updates and deployment links via Telegram
  - [x] Integrate OpenAI for response generation
  - [x] Connect Telegram endpoint to orchestration API
  - [x] Implement status and error feedback loop to user
  - [ ] Tests covering `/status` & error flows
  - [ ] **NEW: User-facing agent customization UI via Telegram**

### 3. On-Demand Agent Creation (Builder Agent)

- [x] **Objective: Implement a Builder Agent that breaks down user feature requests into development tickets, triggers agent creation, and coordinates the build pipeline**
  - [x] Builder Agent receives parsed requests and creates tickets
  - [x] Tickets are processed according to the Cascade Protocol
  - [x] New agents are automatically built, tested, and deployed
  - [x] Implement Builder Agent logic and ticket creation
  - [x] Integrate with Orchestrator and Agent Manager
  - [x] Ensure ticket traceability and test coverage
  - [ ] **NEW: Automated documentation generation for agent workflows**

### 4. Quality Control Agent (QC Agent)

- [ ] **Objective: Implement a QC Agent that reviews agent outputs, test results, and code quality before deployment**
  - [x] QC Agent runs automated tests and acceptance checks
  - [ ] Can halt or roll back deployment on failure
  - [x] Provides feedback and status to user and orchestrator
  - [x] Implement QC Agent logic and hooks
  - [x] Integrate with Builder Agent and Orchestrator
  - [ ] Add notification and rollback mechanisms
  - [ ] **NEW: Automated regression testing for critical agent paths**

### 5. Automated Deployment & Feedback

- [ ] **Objective: Seamlessly deploy new/updated agents to Vercel/serverless or remote Docker, with robust feedback to users and dashboard**
  - [x] Agents are deployed remotely/serverless on completion
  - [x] User receives deployment status and links via Telegram
  - [x] Dashboard/API reflects deployed agents and health
  - [x] Integrate deployment pipeline with Vercel/serverless
  - [x] Sync deployment status to dashboard and Telegram
  - [ ] Add failsafe and rollback for failed deployments
  - [ ] **NEW: Automated deployment verification and alerting**

### 6. Continuous Improvement & Extensibility

- [ ] **Objective: Ensure the system is modular, secure, and easy to extend with new agent types, workflows, or integrations**
  - [x] New agent types and workflows can be added with minimal code changes
  - [x] Security, logging, and permissioning are robust
  - [x] Regression/failure triggers critical alert and halts pipeline
  - [x] Refactor for modularity and plug-in support
  - [x] Implement logging, permission checks, and regression alerts
  - [x] Document extension and integration process
  - [ ] **NEW: Agent self-upgrade/auto-update capability**
  - [ ] **NEW: User-facing agent customization UI (web)**

## Next Steps

- Begin with the next incomplete task within the Milestones above (currently Milestone 0).
- Proceed stepwise through each milestone, following the Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol for ticketing, testing, and deployment.

---

## Planned Modularization: Telegram API Handler

- *Note: This is an active, near-term task.*
- Extract file handling, transcription, OpenAI, and Supabase operations from `pages/api/telegram.ts` into dedicated utils modules (`utils/telegram/*`) for maintainability and testability. Keep the API handler focused on orchestration.
---

## Protocol Adherence Ticket

- *Note: This is an ongoing requirement.*
- Ensure all autonomous work and ticket breakdowns follow the [Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol](./Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md).
- All tickets must have clear objectives, acceptance criteria, and technical approach.
- Review PLAN.md and all tickets for protocol compliance before implementation.
