# Cascade Project State â€” Autonomous Agent Reboot

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-19T21:30:09+02:00

---

## Current Status
- All documentation is now modular:
  - `PLAN.md` contains the current project plan and milestones only.
  - `BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md` contains the backlog, future ideas, and reference materials.
  - `PROJECT_VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md` define vision, architecture, and protocols.
  - `TICKETS_FROM_THE_PAST.md` archives completed tickets and learnings.
- Agent Manager and Orchestrator support live, in-memory agent lifecycle management, health, and logs.
- All core protocols (A2A, Model Context Protocol) are implemented and referenced in architecture.
- Node.js v23.11.0 is required.
- All test suites (Jest, component, integration) are passing and up-to-date.
- No open `task*`, `todo*`, or legacy task files remain in the repo.
- All major documentation files (`README.md`, `DOC.md`, `TESTING.md`) are current and cross-referenced.

## Next Steps for Autonomous Agents
- On reboot, always reference `.PROMPT-Cascade` for canonical project context and file roles.
- Use `PLAN.md` for current milestones and actionable tasks.
- Use `BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md` for autonomous backlog selection and reference.
- Log all decisions, learnings, and operational context to persistent memory (Supabase).
- Follow the Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol for all actions, escalation, and recovery.
- Update this file after any major project state change or milestone completion.

**Ready for autonomous operation and agent-driven development.**

## Key Files for Cascade
- `README.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `DOC.md` (see for architecture, backlog, and protocol)
- All code and test files reflect the latest working state.

## Next Steps After Reboot
- Resume with the next failing or incomplete test suite (e.g., `SentryErrorBoundary.test.tsx`) if any.
- Continue development according to the roadmap in `PLAN.md` and the Cascade Autonomous Protocol.
- Ensure all new features and bugfixes are reflected in this file and the main documentation.

## Reboot Checklist
- [x] All passing tests committed
- [x] Test mocks and config up-to-date
- [x] No stale task/todo files
- [x] Project state and backlog up-to-date in `PLAN.md` and `README.md`
- [x] This file (`TASK_STATE.md`) reflects the latest state

**This file is auto-generated by Cascade to enable seamless reboot and context restoration.**

For any manual changes, please update this file and the main documentation accordingly.
