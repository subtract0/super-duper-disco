# E2E Test Blocked: Node.js Version Mismatch

- **Date:** 2025-04-21
- **Current Node.js Version:** v22.14.0
- **Required Node.js Version:** v23.11.0 (as prompted by E2E script)

## Context
The E2E agent lifecycle test cannot proceed because the script requires Node.js v23.11.0, while the system currently has v22.14.0 installed. This is a hard blocker for automated regression and lifecycle testing.

## Options for Resolution
- Upgrade Node.js to v23.11.0 (requires user approval, may affect other local projects)
- Patch the E2E script to allow running on v22.14.0 if possible (may require code changes or feature flags)

## Next Steps
- Await user decision on Node.js upgrade or patching strategy.
- Keep PLAN.md and this blocker file updated with any changes.
