**Last Updated:** 2025-04-18T14:13:41+02:00

---

## Current Status
- All recent test failures in `components/AuthForm.test.tsx` have been resolved. All tests for this component now pass.
- Supabase client is now mocked in test environments to prevent real network calls.
- Jest and Babel configurations are up-to-date for TSX/JSX and modern React.
- Agent Manager and Orchestrator code have been refactored for robust agent lifecycle and health management.
- No open `task*`, `todo*`, or legacy task files were found in the repo.

## Key Files for Cascade
- `README.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `DOC.md` (see for architecture, backlog, and protocol)
- All code and test files reflect the latest working state.

## Next Steps After Reboot
- Resume with the next failing or incomplete test suite (e.g., `SentryErrorBoundary.test.tsx`) if any.
- Continue development according to the roadmap in `PLAN.md` and the Cascade Autonomous Protocol.
- Ensure all new features and bugfixes are reflected in this file and the main documentation.

## Reboot Checklist
- [x] All passing tests committed
- [x] Test mocks and config up-to-date
- [x] No stale task/todo files
- [x] Project state and backlog up-to-date in `PLAN.md` and `README.md`
- [x] This file (`TASK_STATE.md`) reflects the latest state
