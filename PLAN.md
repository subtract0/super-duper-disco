[Project Vision & Architecture](./PROJECT_VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md) | [Backlog & Reference](./BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md) | [Completed Tickets](./TICKETS_FROM_THE_PAST.md)
---
**Autonomous Operation Notice:**
- All milestones and tasks are designed for stepwise, promptless execution by autonomous agents.
- Agents must always check the latest roadmap, respect ticket boundaries, and update their own progress.
- After each major step, agents must log decisions, learnings, and operational context to persistent memory (Supabase).
- If human review or intervention is required, agents should request it explicitly; otherwise, default to self-recovery/retry.
- All actions must comply with the [Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol](./Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md).

## Milestones & Tasks
### 0. Protocol-Centric Agent Communication (A2A & Model Context Protocol)
- [x] **Objective: Implement A2A and Model Context Protocol as the foundation for all agent communication and context management**
  - [x] Research and document requirements for A2A and Model Context Protocol
  - [x] Build core adapters and middleware for agent-to-agent (A2A) and agent-to-context (Model Context Protocol) messaging
  - [x] Refactor all agent orchestration, messaging, and memory flows to use these protocols as the default
  - [x] Write comprehensive tests for protocol compliance and edge cases
  - **2025-04-20:** Enhanced protocol adapter tests for A2A and Model Context Protocol. Strict validation is now enforced in `parseA2AEnvelope`, robust against malformed input and missing required fields. See `a2aAdapter.test.ts` and `mcpAdapter.test.ts` for new edge case and regression coverage.
  - [x] Document protocol usage and extension points for new agent types
  - **2025-04-20:** Added clear documentation and extension guidance. See `src/protocols/PROTOCOL_REQUIREMENTS.md` for protocol usage, envelope structure, and how to extend with new agent/message types and fields. Follow these docs when adding new protocol logic or agent types.
  - [x] Protocol version negotiation for backward compatibility  
  - **2025-04-20:** Implemented protocol version negotiation logic in both A2A and MCP adapters. See `negotiateA2AVersion` and `negotiateMCPVersion` functions for version fallback/selection. Tests in `a2aAdapter.test.ts` and `mcpAdapter.test.ts` cover negotiation and backward compatibility scenarios.
  - [x] Automated protocol compliance regression tests  
  - **2025-04-20:** Dedicated Jest config (`src/protocols/jest.protocol.config.cjs`) and CI integration ensure all protocol adapters are regression-tested. To run protocol tests: `npx jest --config=src/protocols/jest.protocol.config.cjs`. CI blocks merges on any protocol compliance failure. See badge and details in `PROTOCOL_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- [x] Add adapter for new protocol (e.g. RAG, OpenAI, custom)  
  - **2025-04-20:** New protocol adapter template added in `src/protocols`. Includes strict edge case and compliance tests. See extension guidance in `PROTOCOL_REQUIREMENTS.md` for adding new adapters.
- [x] Tests for new protocol adapter, edge cases, and compliance  
  - **2025-04-20:** All protocol adapters now have Jest-based tests for compliance and edge cases. CI integration ensures regression testing for every adapter. See `src/protocols/__tests__` and `jest.protocol.config.cjs` for details.

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration Foundation

### 2. Autonomous Test Recovery: Telegram Bot Test Suite
- [x] **Objective: Restore and pass all Telegram bot tests after file corruption**
  - [x] Diagnose root cause (file corruption from repeated edits)
  - [x] Surface and fix all remaining test failures (add logging, debug mocks)
  - [x] Remove temporary sanity test after all pass
  - **2025-04-20:** All Telegram bot tests now pass. Handler logic for `/stop <id>` and unknown agents is robust, with actionable error/help messages. Orchestrator mocks in tests now include `getAgent` and `listAgents` to match production logic. All tests green. Next: propagate error handling improvements to other agent commands and conversational flows, and keep PLAN.md updated.
  - **2025-04-20:** Error handling for `/delete <id>` and `/update-config <id>` is now robust. The bot sends actionable, user-friendly messages if a user tries to delete or update a non-existent agent, both for direct commands and in dialogue. Invalid config JSON is also handled with clear feedback. Next: propagate this pattern to `/launch` and ensure all flows are covered by tests.
  - **2025-04-20:** Error handling for `/launch <id> [type]` is now robust. The bot provides actionable, user-friendly messages for invalid/duplicate launches and surfaces config errors clearly. All flows are covered by tests. **NOTE:** All agent mocks in orchestration and Telegram bot tests must implement the EventEmitter interface (e.g., use BaseAgent or an EventEmitter subclass). This prevents `TypeError: agent.on is not a function` during deployAgent calls.
  - **2025-04-20:** Migrated the QCAgent review test to its own integration test file (qcAgent.integration.test.ts) using dependency injection. This avoids fetch/polyfill issues caused by real SDK imports in orchestrator tests.
- All agent mocks must implement the EventEmitter interface to prevent TypeError during deployment and orchestration tests.
- Orchestrator and agent tests are now modular, regression-proofed, and kept under 200-300 lines per file as per codebase rules.
- Real SDKs (e.g., openai, langchain) should not be imported in orchestrator tests unless strictly necessary; use dependency injection and minimal mocks for all agent logic.
- The approach ensures robust, environment-agnostic tests and aligns with project maintainability and modularity goals.
- **2025-04-20:** Telegram bot agent control flows (/stop, /restart, /delete, /update-config, /launch, etc.) now have consistent, actionable, and regression-proof error handling. User-friendly messages are provided for missing/invalid agent IDs, config, or commands. Fallback/default branches always give feedback, and dialogue state handling prompts for missing info. This pattern must be followed for all new commands and features to maintain UX and code quality.
   - **2025-04-20:** Regression patch: All agent mocks in orchestration tests (e.g., agentManager.factory.test.ts, agentManager.test.ts) now use EventEmitter-compatible mocks. This resolves the `agent.on is not a function` error in those tests and fully regression-proofs orchestration agent mocks. Note: The fetch polyfill (undici) must be loaded at the very top of the Jest setup, before any SDK imports, to avoid environment errors. Some environment errors persist in agentOrchestrator.test.ts and related files; these will be triaged next.
- **2025-04-20:** Autonomous code quality improvements: Added .eslintignore to ignore .next, node_modules, and build output. Ran ESLint autofix on src, test, and utils. Remaining manual issues mostly relate to 'any' types, unused vars, and forbidden require() imports. Next: incrementally refactor to remove 'any', unused vars, and forbidden require() imports in source/test/utils for full compliance.
- **2025-04-20:** Incremental lint refactor: Refactored src/utils/getHealthDisplay.ts to use const where possible per lint rules. This is part of the ongoing plan to incrementally remove lint errors and improve type safety in the codebase.
- **2025-04-20:** Incremental lint/code quality improvement: Refactored src/utils/notify.ts to remove 'any' type and unused variables, added JSDoc placeholder for email notification. Continuing the plan to incrementally remove lint errors and improve type safety.
- **2025-04-20:** Incremental lint/code quality improvement: Refactored src/orchestration/agentManager.factory.test.ts to remove 'any' type from agentManager.listAgents().forEach. This is part of the ongoing plan to incrementally remove lint errors and improve type safety in the codebase.
- **2025-04-20:** Incremental lint/code quality improvement: Refactored src/orchestration/agentManager.test.ts to remove 'any' types from agentManager.listAgents() and mark dynamic require() usages with eslint-disable-next-line for lint compliance. Continuing the plan to incrementally remove lint errors and improve type safety.
- **2025-04-20:** Incremental lint/code quality improvement: Refactored src/orchestration/agentOrchestrator.test.ts to remove 'any' types from agentManager.listAgents() and orchestrator.listAgents() usages. This is part of the ongoing plan to incrementally remove lint errors and improve type safety in the codebase.

- [x] **Objective: Refactor and extend the Agent Manager and Orchestrator for dynamic, in-memory agent lifecycle management and health monitoring**
  - [x] Agents can be launched, stopped, monitored, and auto-recovered (via Telegram: `/launch`, `/stop <id>`, `/restart <id>`, `/status`)
{{ ... }}
  - [x] Modular support for native, LangChain, and AutoGen agents
{{ ... }}
  - [x] Audit/refactor `agentManager.ts` and `agentOrchestrator.ts`
  - [x] In-memory health store, heartbeats, auto-restart
  - [x] Telegram bot as primary UI/dashboard
  - [x] Add `/launch` command for on-demand agent creation
  - [x] Tests for orchestrator-state endpoint & health flows  
  - **2025-04-20:** Orchestrator-state API endpoint and agent health flows are now covered by tests. See `agentManager.test.ts` and `agentOrchestrator.test.ts` for orchestration/health coverage.
  - [x] Automated chaos testing for agent recovery  
  - **2025-04-20:** Chaos testing implemented: agent crash, missed heartbeat, and auto-recovery scenarios are simulated in `agentManager.test.ts` and `agentOrchestrator.test.ts`. Coverage includes deliberate crash, missed heartbeat detection, orchestrator-triggered restart, and failover handling. See test descriptions for details.
- [x] Agent performance analytics and reporting  
  - **2025-04-20:** AgentManager now tracks in-memory analytics: uptime (via lastHeartbeat/lastActivity), restart/crash count (`crashCount`), and logs for response time estimation. Analytics are accessible via orchestrator methods and can be queried for reporting. See `AgentManager` fields and methods for details.

## Milestone (2025-04-20): Orchestrator Agent Status Alignment

- **Context:** Orchestrator mock now aligns agent status to 'running' for all agent lifecycle events, matching Telegram handler expectations for /status and agent management commands.
- **Result:** Status, restart, and config update tests now reflect correct status strings. This resolves mismatches between test agent state and handler output.
- **Next Step:** Review handler logic and test expectations for config update and malformed JSON conversational tests, as they still return generic fallback error messages.
- **Action:** Proceed to review handler and patch tests or handler as needed. Update PLAN.md and TESTING.md after each fix.

---

## Milestone (2025-04-20): Telegram Agent Management Conversational Config Tests Patched

- **Context:** Patched conversational config update and malformed JSON tests to launch agents with correct IDs before running handler, ensuring handler recognizes agent IDs.
- **Result:** Tests now surface correct conversational prompts and actionable error messages for config update and malformed JSON cases.
- **Next Step:** Review and patch natural language stop test if needed, then re-run tests and document results.
- **Action:** Proceed to review and patch natural language stop test, update PLAN.md and TESTING.md after each fix.

---

## Milestone (2025-04-20): Telegram Agent Management Test Suite Orchestrator Mock Realigned

- **Context:** Orchestrator mock in `telegram.commands.test.ts` now maintains a mutable in-memory agent list, matching agent lifecycle flows in tests.
- **Result:** /status and agent management commands now reflect test-launched agents, resolving previous mock/test mismatch. Realistic agent state transitions are now covered.
- **Next Step:** Investigate and patch conversational flow tests (config update, malformed JSON, natural language stop) to ensure handler and test inputs are aligned. Focus on surfacing actionable error messages and correct conversational prompts.
- **Action:** Proceed to review and patch conversational flow tests, update PLAN.md and TESTING.md after each fix.

---

### 2025-04-20: Modular Telegram Bot Refactor Complete
- All Telegram bot command, dialogue, and file logic is now modularized in `src/telegram/` (`types.ts`, `intentParser.ts`, `dialogueState.ts`, `fileService.ts`, `telegramApi.ts`, `controller.ts`, `handler.ts`).
- `pages/api/telegram.ts` is a thin wrapper delegating to the modular handler.
- Orchestrator is now wired to the live `agentManager` and `MessageBus`, so all bot commands operate on real in-memory agent state.
- All top-level side effects, secret logging, and monolithic logic have been removed.
- **Next:** Migrate/validate tests for all conversational flows, ensure robust error handling, and update documentation. Maintain PLAN.md after each major step.

## Milestone (2025-04-20): Telegram Agent Management Test Suite Unblocked, Failing Tests Remain

- **Context:** Patched `telegram.commands.test.ts` to mock `orchestratorSingleton` before handler import, following the working pattern from `telegram-agent-commands.test.ts`.
- **Result:** Jest transform/import error resolved. Test suite now runs, but several tests fail (6 failed, 4 passed).
- **Next Step:** Diagnose and fix failing test assertions for Telegram agent management edge cases. Focus on correct user notification and agent state handling.
- **Action:** Proceed to review failing test output, update tests or mocks as needed, and document fixes.

---

## Milestone (2025-04-20): Telegram Agent Management Test Suite Blocked

- **Context:** Added comprehensive tests for Telegram agent management edge cases (`telegram.commands.test.ts`).
- **Result:** Test suite fails to run due to Jest transform error (importing orchestratorSingleton/Next.js API route).
- **Root Cause:** Likely due to Next.js/Jest config or module resolution, not test or production code logic.
- **Next Step:** Investigate and patch Jest config or mocks to allow API route and orchestratorSingleton imports in test environment.
- **Action:** All code and test logic reviewed and confirmed correct. Issue is environmental or Jest config related.

---

  - **2025-04-20:** AgentManager now tracks in-memory analytics: uptime (via lastHeartbeat/lastActivity), restart/crash count (`crashCount`), and logs for response time estimation. Analytics are accessible via orchestrator methods and can be queried for reporting. See `AgentManager` fields and methods for details.
- [x] User-facing agent customization UI in Telegram  
  - **2025-04-20:** Telegram bot now supports `/customize`, `/delete`, and `/update-config` commands for agent management. Users can view, update, and delete agents live from Telegram. See the command handling logic in `pages/api/telegram.ts` and orchestration integration for details.
- [x] Agent deletion and config update commands
