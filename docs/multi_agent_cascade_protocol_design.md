# Multi-Agent Cascade Protocol Design (LangChain + AutoGen)

## Overview
This document captures the design rationale and detailed workflow for implementing the Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol using a multi-agent system, wiring LangChain agents into AutoGen for advanced orchestration.

## Protocol Breakdown & Mapping

### Cascade Protocol Steps
1. **Idea Input:** User provides idea (trigger).
2. **Research:** Analyze idea, research tech stack, features, competitors, risks. Output: Product plan.
3. **Ticketing:** Break down plan into actionable tickets.
4. **Refinement:** Deep research per ticket, update tickets.
5. **Testing Prep:** Define automated tests, setup framework.
6. **Coding Loop:** Write tests/code, run/debug iteratively.
7. **Commit:** Document, commit to GitHub, verify CI.
8. **Repeat:** Loop until all tickets done. Notify user.

### Key Agent Roles
- **PlannerAgent:** Project manager/architect. Orchestrates, breaks down tasks, tracks progress.
- **ResearcherAgent:** Information gatherer. Web search, doc analysis, deep dives.
- **DeveloperAgent:** Coder/tester. Implements tickets, TDD, runs tests, interacts with file/code tools.
- **DevOpsAgent:** Version control, CI/CD. Handles commits, checks CI, manages repo.

Roles can be combined or expanded as needed for scalability.

## Agent Specializations

### PlannerAgent (AutoGen AssistantAgent)
- **Role:** Orchestrates protocol, manages plan/tickets, tracks state, notifies user.
- **Tools:** Task/ticket management, communication tools.
- **Memory:** Full project plan, ticket status (long-term).

### ResearcherAgent (AutoGen AssistantAgent + LangChain Tools)
- **Role:** Deep research, analysis, synthesis.
- **Tools:** WebSearchTool, ArXivTool, WikipediaTool, DocumentLoaderTool (all via LangChain).
- **Memory:** Context of current research request (short-term).

### DeveloperAgent (AutoGen UserProxyAgent)
- **Role:** Implements code/tests per ticket, TDD, requests clarification, hands off to DevOps.
- **Tools:** FileSystemTool, CodeExecutionTool, request_clarification_research, notify_code_ready.
- **Memory:** Ticket details, code/tests, test results.

### DevOpsAgent (AutoGen UserProxyAgent)
- **Role:** Handles Git/CI, commits, verifies pipeline, reports status.
- **Tools:** GitTool, GitHubApiTool, FileSystemTool.
- **Memory:** Repo details, branch, last commit/CI status.

## Orchestration & Workflow

- **AutoGen GroupChatManager** coordinates agent conversation.
- **PlannerAgent** initiates, receives user idea, requests research, creates/assigns tickets.
- **ResearcherAgent** performs research, returns to Planner/Developer.
- **DeveloperAgent** implements tickets, requests clarification, notifies DevOps.
- **DevOpsAgent** commits code, verifies CI, reports back.
- **PlannerAgent** tracks ticket completion, notifies user at end.

Agents communicate via explicit messages (e.g., "@ResearcherAgent please research X"). State is tracked via messages and/or persistent storage.

## LangChain Integration Points
- **Tools:** LangChain's search, doc, and code tools are wrapped for agent use.
- **Chains:** For complex tasks, agents can invoke LangChain chains (e.g., LLMChain, RetrievalQA).
- **Memory:** Use LangChain's memory modules or persistent storage as needed.

---

## Implementation Notes
- Start with 4 core agents, expand as needed.
- Use robust system messages and prompts to guide each agent's behavior.
- Secure tool execution (especially code/Git commands).
- Test each agent individually before full integration.
- Optimize for cost and token usage.
