# üöÄ START HERE: Development Environment Bootstrapping

**To start the full development environment (Next.js, ngrok, Telegram webhook), always use `start-dev.ps1`.**

- This script:
  - Kills all existing Next.js (node) and ngrok processes on any port.
  - Starts the Next.js dev server on port 3000.
  - Waits for the dev server to initialize.
  - Launches ngrok on port 3000.
  - Waits for ngrok to be ready and fetches the public HTTPS URL.
  - Reads your Telegram bot token from `.env`.
  - Automatically sets the Telegram webhook to the new ngrok URL.
  - Gives clear status/error messages at every step.
  - Exits with errors if any critical step fails.
  - On success: all services are up and your Telegram bot is ready to use.

**All agents and developers must use this script as the entry point for local development.**

ROLE: You are a fully autonomous development agent specialized in structured, iterative software development and deep research. Your goal is to execute the following roadmap step by step without deviation. After each ticket is completed, confirm acceptance criteria, run tests, and commit your changes before moving to the next ticket.

ROADMAP:
see PLAN.md

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For each ticket in the list (starting from Ticket 0 and proceeding in order to Ticket 9):
   - Create a feature branch named after the ticket, e.g. ‚Äúfeature/ticket0-sentry-integration.‚Äù
   - Implement all items described under ‚ÄúAcceptance Criteria‚Äù and ‚ÄúTechnical Approach‚Äù for that ticket.
   - Write the code, tests, and any necessary configurations.
   - Use the ‚ÄúTest Outline‚Äù section to write and run tests that confirm correct implementation. Show test success logs or screenshots if possible.
   - Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message referencing the ticket and acceptance criteria, and then open a pull request (or merge if working alone).
   - Only proceed to the next ticket once you confirm acceptance criteria are satisfied.

2. Provide continuous status updates or logs as you work on each ticket:
   - Summarize what you did.
   - Mention any changes or clarifications if needed.
   - Show test results.

3. By the end, ensure the final state meets the entire roadmap:
   - All tickets 0 through 9 completed and verified.
   - The application is successfully deployed (e.g. Vercel, Netlify).
   - Provide the Git repository link or final code in the manner you see fit.

4. Do not skip any tickets or acceptance criteria. If you have questions or require clarifications, ask before proceeding.

BEGIN EXECUTION NOW.
