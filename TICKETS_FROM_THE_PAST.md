# TICKETS FROM THE PAST
This document serves as an archive for all completed and historical tickets, design discussions, and major architectural decisions. For the current and future roadmap, see [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md).

## Completed & Historical Tickets

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration Foundation
- **Objective:** Refactor and extend the Agent Manager and Orchestrator for dynamic, in-memory agent lifecycle management and health monitoring.
  - [x] Agents can be launched, stopped, monitored, and auto-recovered
  - [x] Health status, logs, and live state are accessible via API/dashboard
  - [x] Modular support for native, LangChain, and AutoGen agents
  - [x] Audit and refactor `src/orchestration/agentManager.ts` and `agentOrchestrator.ts`
  - [x] Implement in-memory health store, heartbeats, and auto-restart
  - [x] Add/extend API endpoints and dashboard for live state

**Key Learnings for Agents:**
- Always use the AgentManager as the single source of truth for agent state.
- Ensure health checks and auto-recovery are protocol-compliant and avoid duplicate agent state.
- Log all recovery actions and state changes to persistent memory for future reference.

### 2. Telegram Bot Conversational Interface
- **Objective:** Upgrade `/api/telegram` endpoint and bot logic to accept natural language feature requests and route them to the orchestration system.
  - [x] Telegram bot receives feature requests and parses intent
  - [x] Regex-based parser generates actionable agent creation tickets
  - [x] Integrate OpenAI for response generation

**Key Learnings for Agents:**
- Always parse input intent using the latest protocol-compliant parser.
- Log all feature requests and parsing errors for traceability.
- Provide status updates and escalate only if user feedback is required by protocol.

### 3. On-Demand Agent Creation (Builder Agent)
- **Objective:** Implement a Builder Agent that breaks down user feature requests into development tickets, triggers agent creation, and coordinates the build pipeline.
  - [x] Builder Agent receives parsed requests and creates tickets
  - [x] Tickets are processed according to the Cascade Protocol
  - [x] Implement Builder Agent logic and ticket creation
  - [x] Integrate with Orchestrator and Agent Manager

**Key Learnings for Agents:**
- Always ensure ticket traceability and log ticket state changes.
- Use the Cascade Protocol for all ticket breakdowns and handoffs.
- Escalate only if ticket cannot be processed autonomously.

### Additional Completed Tickets & Major Decisions
- Initial project bootstrapping and repo setup
- Design and implementation of the original monolithic PLAN.md
- Migration to modular documentation (PLAN.md, PROJECT_VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md, BACKLOG_REFERENCE.md)
- Adoption of the Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol
- Implementation of Supabase for persistent memory
- Integration of A2A and Model Context Protocols as architectural foundations

**Key Learnings for Agents:**
- Modular documentation and protocol adherence improve agent autonomy and maintainability.
- Always reference the latest protocol and architectural docs before executing tasks.
