## Backlog Tickets

### 1. Core Test: Text Message Flow
- **Objective:** Ensure a text message sent to Telegram is processed, stored in Supabase, and replied to by the agent.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Text message is received and saved in Supabase
  - Agent reply is generated via OpenAI and sent back to Telegram
  - Test passes with mocked Telegram and OpenAI APIs
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Write an integration test for the `/api/telegram` endpoint using mocked dependencies

### 2. Core Test: File Upload Flow
- **Objective:** Verify images/documents from Telegram are downloaded, uploaded to Supabase, and URLs are stored.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - File is received, uploaded to Supabase Storage
  - URL is saved in Supabase messages
  - Test passes with mocked file and Supabase APIs
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Add a test with a sample image/document message and validate storage logic

### 3. Core Test: Voice Transcription Flow
- **Objective:** Confirm a voice message is transcribed using Whisper and the result is processed and replied to.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Voice message is received, transcribed, and stored
  - Agent reply is generated and sent
  - Test passes with mocked Whisper and OpenAI APIs
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Add a test for voice message handling with transcription mocking

### 4. Core Test: OpenAI Integration
- **Objective:** Ensure agent replies are generated and saved using OpenAI (mocked responses).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - OpenAI API is called with correct payload
  - Agent reply is saved and sent
  - Test passes with OpenAI mocked
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Unit test for the `callOpenAIGPT` helper with mocked axios/OpenAI

### 5. Core Test: Error Handling
- **Objective:** Simulate failures (Supabase/OpenAI down) and verify error logging and user notification.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Errors are logged
  - User receives a helpful error message via Telegram
  - Test passes for both Supabase and OpenAI failures
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Integration tests with forced errors and assertion on user notification

### 6. Documentation and Architecture Ticket
- **Objective:** Keep documentation (README.md, DOC.md, PLAN.md) in sync with code and architecture changes.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All docs are up-to-date after major changes
  - PLAN.md reflects new tickets and completed work
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Add/update docs as part of PR acceptance checklist

### 7. Swarm Agent Orchestration (Autogen & LangChain)
- **Objective:** Integrate autogen 0.2 and LangChain to orchestrate and manage multiple agents.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - System can launch, monitor, and coordinate multiple agent processes.
  - Agents can communicate and share state as needed.
  - Swarm can be started/stopped programmatically or via config.
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Add a new orchestration module using autogen 0.2 primitives.
  - Use LangChain for agent composition and workflow logic.
  - Document agent lifecycle and communication patterns.

### 8. Agent Specialization & Registration
- **Objective:** Enable specialization of agents for tasks (Telegram, file, voice, etc.) and register them dynamically.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Agents can be dynamically registered with the swarm.
  - Each agent can declare its specialization and capabilities.
  - Swarm can route tasks to the appropriate agent.
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Define an agent registry and capability schema.
  - Implement dynamic agent registration and routing logic.

### 9. Remote & Codeless Deployment Interface
- **Objective:** Allow agents to be deployed remotely or codelessly (via config, UI, or API).
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Agents can be launched on remote hosts or containers.
  - Users can deploy new agents without code changes (via config or web UI).
  - System validates and manages agent deployments.
  - UI/UX meets the requirements outlined in Ticket 13 (see below).
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Add a deployment manager supporting remote hosts (e.g., SSH, Docker, cloud).
  - Build a config-driven or web-based deployment UI/API.
  - Document deployment flows for technical and non-technical users.
  - Collaborate with UI/UX team to ensure usability for non-technical users.

### 13. UI/UX for Codeless Agent Deployment
- **Objective:** Make it possible for technical and non-technical users to deploy, manage, and monitor agents in the swarm without writing code.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Step-by-step agent deployment wizard (choose type, set config, environment, etc.).
  - Visual agent registry and dashboard with health/status, logs, and controls.
  - Edit agent configs via forms, upload/download config files, versioning.
  - Support for remote/multi-host deployment (add hosts, deploy to hosts, monitor usage).
  - User-friendly error handling and notifications (email, Slack, etc.).
  - Role-based access control and secure secret management via UI.
  - Inline help, tooltips, and guided tutorials for new users.
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Design and implement a web UI using a modern stack (e.g., Next.js, React, Chakra UI, or similar).
  - Integrate with backend deployment manager and agent registry APIs.
  - Gather feedback from both technical and non-technical users for iterative improvement.

### 10. Swarm Health, Monitoring & Recovery
- **Objective:** Monitor agent health, recover crashed agents, and provide admin visibility.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Swarm dashboard or CLI shows agent status, logs, and resource usage.
  - Crashed agents are automatically restarted or replaced.
  - Admins are notified of failures and can intervene.
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Integrate health checks and auto-restart logic.
  - Add basic dashboard or CLI for monitoring and control.

### 11. Security, Permissions & Isolation
- **Objective:** Ensure agents are sandboxed and only have access to their permitted resources.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Each agent runs with least privilege.
  - Communication is authenticated and encrypted.
  - Sensitive data is protected in transit and at rest.
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Use OS/container isolation and environment variables.
  - Add agent authentication and encrypted channels.
  - Document security model and best practices.

### 12. Documentation & Example Deployments
- **Objective:** Provide clear documentation and ready-to-use examples for agent swarm deployment.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Docs cover architecture, setup, agent registration, deployment, and monitoring.
  - Example configs for local, remote, and cloud deployment.
  - Tutorials for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Update README, DOC.md, and add example config files.
  - Provide step-by-step guides for common deployment scenarios.

### 7. Protocol Adherence Ticket
- **Objective:** Ensure all autonomous work and ticket breakdowns follow the [Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol](./Cascade_Autonomous_Development_Protocol.md)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All tickets have clear objectives, acceptance criteria, and technical approach
  - Deep research and refinement steps are followed for new features
- **Recommended Approach:**
  - Review PLAN.md and all tickets for protocol compliance before implementation
