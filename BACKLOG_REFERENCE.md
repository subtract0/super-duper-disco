# Backlog & Reference

[← Back to PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) | [See Project Vision & Architecture](./PROJECT_VISION_ARCHITECTURE.md)


---


## Purpose

*This file contains the detailed backlog, future development ideas, appendices, and reference materials not required for the agent's immediate sequential execution.*


---


## Environment Requirement

- Node.js v23.11.0 is required and active.

## How to Use This Backlog (For Autonomous Agents)

- Agents may autonomously select any backlog item marked as `[autonomous-ready]` for execution, unless protocol or ticket states otherwise.
- When claiming a task, update persistent memory and ticket status.
- Upon completion, log learnings and update the ticket as completed.
- If a task is not `[autonomous-ready]`, escalate for human review or clarification.
- Always follow the Cascade Autonomous Development Protocol when updating or executing backlog items.

## Multi-Agent Orchestration: LangChain & AutoGen

### Objective
Design and implement a robust, production-grade multi-agent orchestration system where agents with different roles, tools, and memory can collaborate on complex tasks. Ensure high reliability (health monitoring, auto-recovery), extensibility (plug-in agent types), and support for advanced LLM workflows.

### Milestones
1. **Agent Lifecycle Management**
   - Launch, stop, restart agents as processes
   - Monitor health (pending, healthy, crashed, restarting)
   - Auto-recovery for crashed agents
2. **Agent Types & Integration**
   - Native agents (custom logic)
   - LangChain agents (LLM, tools, memory)
   - AutoGen agents (multi-agent conversation, team coordination)
   - Hybrid agents (LangChain-powered brains inside AutoGen agents)
3. **Multi-Agent Workflow**
   - Role-based agents (Planner, Researcher, Coder, etc.)
   - Each agent tracks its own conversation history (memory)
   - Agents can use tools/APIs/code
   - Round-robin or protocol-driven collaboration
   - Task decomposition and delegation
4. **Health & Reliability**
   - In-memory health store
   - Heartbeats and health checks
   - Auto-restart on crash
   - Dashboard/API reflect live state
5. **Extensibility**
   - Plug-and-play agent types
   - Add new roles, tools, or workflows easily
   - Support both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios

### Acceptance Criteria
- Agents of different types (native, LangChain, AutoGen) can be launched, stopped, and monitored
- Health status is tracked and auto-recovery is triggered on crash
- Agents can collaborate on a task, passing messages with role/context awareness
- System supports extension with new agent types, tools, and workflows
- Comprehensive tests cover agent lifecycle, health, and collaboration

### Recommended Technical Approach
- Use Node.js + TypeScript for orchestration and agent management
- Implement agent classes for each type; use LangChain for LLM/tool/memory, AutoGen for multi-agent protocols
- Orchestrator manages process lifecycle, health, and recovery
- Agents communicate via message passing, with role/context prompts and memory
- Add APIs and dashboard to reflect live agent state and logs
- Write integration tests for all critical flows
